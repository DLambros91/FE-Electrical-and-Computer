# FE-Electrical-and-Computer

The FE exam is a computer-based test (CBT). It is closed book with an electronic reference.

Examinees have 6 hours to complete the exam, which contains 110 questions. The 6-hour time also
includes a tutorial and an optional scheduled break. 

The FE exam uses both the International System of Units (SI) and the US Customary System
(USCS).
